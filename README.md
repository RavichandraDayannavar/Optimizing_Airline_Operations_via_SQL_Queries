## Optimizing_Airline_Operations_via_SQL_Queries
Welcome to the Airline Database Query Project, a comprehensive exploration of a richly detailed airline database. This project delves into essential aspects of airline operations, answering a diverse set of business and operational queries using SQL. Each query represents a unique challenge and provides valuable insights into the functioning of flights, bookings, and passenger details.

📌 Project Overview:
The airline database comprises tables like flights, aircrafts, tickets, ticket_flights, airports, seats, bookings, and boarding_passes. These tables encapsulate the intricate details of airline operations, from flight schedules and passenger information to booking details and seat allocations.

This project addresses real-world scenarios by solving practical queries, unlocking insights that are crucial for airline management and decision-making.

🚀 Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To demonstrate proficiency in SQL by solving a diverse range of queries.
- To analyze airline data and extract actionable insights.
- To enhance the understanding of relational databases and query optimization techniques.
  
📊 Questions and Insights:
This project covers the following queries:
1. Date Formatting:
- Representing the book_date column in the Bookings table in the format yyyy-mmm-dd.
- Extracted Columns: book_ref, book_date, total_amount.
2. Passenger Details:
- Retrieve key details like ticket_no, boarding_no, seat_number, passenger_id, and passenger_name.
3. Seat Analysis:
- Identify the least allocated seat across all flights.
4. Monthly Insights:
- Find the highest and least paying passengers on a month-by-month basis.
- Extracted Columns: Month_name (mmm-yy format), passenger_id, passenger_name, total_amount.
5. Return Journey Analysis:
- Identify passengers with return journeys (more than one flight).
- Extracted Columns: passenger_id, passenger_name, ticket_number, flight_count.
6. Boarding Pass Analysis:
- Count the number of tickets without boarding passes.
7. Flight Details:
- Identify details of the longest flight, including flight_number, departure_airport, arrival_airport, aircraft_code, and duration.
- Extract morning and early-morning flights with specific time ranges (6 AM–11 AM and 2 AM–6 AM).
8. Geographic Insights:
- List airport codes in the Europe/Moscow timezone.
9. Aircraft and Fare Insights:
- Count seats by fare condition for each aircraft and find the number of aircraft with at least one business-class seat.
10. Airport Operations:
- Find airports with the highest and lowest number of scheduled departure flights.
- Analyze flights departing from specific airports (DME, KZN, etc.).
11. Flight Patterns:
- Identify flights within a specific range of IDs or using aircraft from the "Airbus" company that were canceled or delayed.
  
🛠️ Tools and Technologies:
- SQL: The primary language for writing queries and extracting insights.
- Relational Database: Leveraged for efficient storage and retrieval of complex airline data.
- GitHub: For version control and project documentation.
  
💡 Key Takeaways:

1. Query Proficiency: Mastery in writing and optimizing SQL queries for diverse use cases.
2. Data Analysis: Gained a deeper understanding of airline operations and customer behavior through data.
3. Problem-Solving: Addressed complex challenges by designing structured and efficient solutions.
